# Tata Consultancy Services Stock Dividends and Stock Splits Calculations (2004-2021)
This project visualizes TCS stock dividends and stock splits from 2004 to 2021. I used web scraping to implement the dataset's information into my code and run from the website without actually downloading the CSV file. I used the Python computer programming language and Jupyter Notebooks to create visualizations.
