# 2004-to-2021-Tata-Consultancy-Services-stock-dividends-and-stock-splits
This project visualizes TCS stock dividends and stock splits from 2004 to 2021. I used web scraping to implement the dataset's information into my code and run from the website without actually downloading the csv file. I used the Python computer programming language and Jupyter Notebooks to create visualizations.
